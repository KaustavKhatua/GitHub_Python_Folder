# Take two numbers as input. Interchange them.

## If-else condition
## Note: You are allowed to use simple condition (ie. only one condition at a time), for example: using & or | is not allowed. Also say to 
## ckeck whether a number is between 2 and 10 you cannot use 2 <= a <= 10 (because this also checks two conditions one for 2 <= a, anoter for a <= 10). 
## You are only allowed to write one condition at a time.

# Take two numbers from user, store them in varibles named purchase_price and selling_price. Suppose a seller has bought an item in purchase_price and sold it
# in selling_price. Print whether he has gained or lossed also the percentage gain or loss. Example: Suppose the purchase_price is 100 and selling_price is 110.
# Output should be "10% gain". Hint: use formatted string.

# Any quadratic equation is of the form a.x^2 + b.x + c = 0. Take three numbers as input, store these in a, b, c. Check whether the roots are real or imaginary.
# Print "Real" if the roots are real, else print "Imaginary".

# Take two numbers as input. Find maximum between these two numbers.

# Take three numbers as input. Find minimum between these three numbers.

# Take three number as input. Find difference between the largest and smallest number.

# Take a number as input. Print "Less than 10" if number is less than 10, print "Between 11 and 20" if number is between 11 and 20, print 
# "Between 21 and 30" if number is between 21 and 30, print "Between 31 and 40" if number is between 31 and 40 (remember you are not allowed to use two <= in
# one condition).

# Take three numbers as input. Print "Triangle" if the three numbers can form a triangle, print "Not triangle" if they do not form a triangle.

# Take four numbers as input. Print "Square" if the four numbers form a  square, print "Not Square" if they do not form a square.


## for loop questions.
# Print -10 to -1.
