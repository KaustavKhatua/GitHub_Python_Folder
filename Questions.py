## Fundamental data types and storing one value into a variable.
# Store an integer value into a variable named integer_variable.
# Store an float value into a variable named float_variable.
# Store an string into a variable named string_variable.
# Store an boolean value into a variable named boolean_variable.

## Type casting
# Convert float_variable to integer and print the result.
# Convert boolean_variable to integer and print the result.
# Add integer_variable and boolean_variable. Print the result and explain why this result came.

## Some operations on integer.
# Take an integer from user and store it in a variable.
# Add 2 to the variable and print the result.
# Calculate the remainder when the variable is divided by 5.
# Calculate square of the value stored in the variable.

## Collection type of data types and storing multiple values into a variable.
# Create a set of 5 elements.
# Create a list of 7 elements.
# Take a number from user and add this number at the last of the list.
# Print length of the list.

## Some operations on list.
# Store a list of length 5 in a variable.
# Print second element of the list.
# Calculate sum of second and third element of the list.
# Calculate product of first and fifth element.
# Print last element of the list.
# Print second last element of the list.

## For loop
# Print 0 to 10.
# Print 1 to 10.
# Print 10 to 14.
# Take an integer from user and print from 0 upto that digit. For example: if user gives input 5 then, print 0 to 5 in console.
# Take an integer from user and print from 1 upto that digit. For example: if user gives input 5 then, print 1 to 5 in console.
# Take an integer from user and print from that digit to 1. For example if user gives input 5 then in console print 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
# Take an integer from user. Calculate sum of 1 to that digit. For example if user gives input 5 then sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
# Take an integer from user. Calculate product of 1 to that digit. For example if user gives input 5 then product of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
# Take an integer from user. Print multiplication table for that number.
# Take an integer from user. Print factorial of that number.

## If-else condition
# Take a number from user. If the number is greater than 5 print "Number is greater than 5".
# Take a string from user. If the string is equal to 'A' print "You have written A".

## While loop.
# Do all the questions in for loop using while loop.
